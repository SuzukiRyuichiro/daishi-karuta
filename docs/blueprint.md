# **App Name**: Karuta Kicker

## Core Features:

- Play Button: Display a play button on the main screen.
- Automatic Reading Playback: Automatically play card readings (initially auto-generated) when the 'Play' button is pressed, reading one card at a time.
- Card Display: After the reading is done, the application will flip to reveal a card that shows the current reading in written format.
- Next Card Functionality: A 'Next' button will advance to the next random, unread card (with a slight buffer between readings).
- Deck Setup Page: A page where users can set the list of card readings and essentially set up the whole deck.
- Non-Repeating Random Order: Implement logic to ensure cards are read in random order without repetition until all cards are read.
- Reset Button: A 'Reset' button to start a new game with the full deck available again.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep red (#A8324B) evoking Japanese cultural themes, such as traditional lacquerware or calligraphy seals. A color often associated with passion and energy.
- Background color: Off-white (#F2EFE9) to mimic the look of washi paper. A light neutral background improves readability.
- Accent color: Muted gold (#B2996E) to highlight interactive elements. It offers a premium feel.
- Use fonts which support Japanese character sets, as well as latin character sets. Use one font for display and another one for the card's actual text.
- Use simple, minimalist icons that represent the card game and actions (play, next, reset).
- Keep the layout clean and uncluttered, focusing on the play area with card display and minimal UI controls. The card should take center stage.
- Use more playful transitions and animations when flipping the card and moving to the next reading to enhance the user experience.
